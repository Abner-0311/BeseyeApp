This is based off the scripts that the Bambuser folks have shared:

Their version turns off almost all of the decoders and disables access to the
filesystem (the file protocol). In order to generate the libs sitting in the
jni directory I turned back on a few options and compiled their stuff. You can
give that a try if you need to turn on additional options. But it should also
work to just use the .a files already in the jni directory when you download
this.

Right now all this does is open up a video file from the filesystem (hardcoded
to /sdcard/vid.3gp in native.c right now), and it'll advance frame by frame
through the video as you hit the "Frame" button and draw the image into a
bitmap that gets displayed on the screen.
